# Donutz-s-iRacing-Button-Dashboard
DIBD is a SimHub dashboard / touchscreen button box especially created for iRacing. It is not meant to be a standalone dash but rather a support device for PitStop planning and other adjustments during your race. Such as controlling other SimHub dashboards, your wind engine etc.<br>
The header shows track and weather info including a little arrow indicating the development of the specific detail. The footer gives info about your performance against other drivers. Currently you can switch between [last lap time/tire compound] and [gap/stint/tire compound] of same car class. Just press the line to switch between these modes.<br>
<br>
<br>
Important things: 
  - Please copy the Dons_settings.json file to SimHub\JavascriptExtensions folder and edit it to your likes.
  - To make this Dashboard working you need to install RomainRob's iRacing Extra Properties plugin for Simhub.
  - Also make sure that you map the key "t" as your text chat hotkey in iRacing.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here you can adjust a few color settings but also the label text of the "Dashboard Settings" page. More flexibility is planned for future releases.<br>
You need to map the buttons using the common SimHub methods. Don't hesitate to ping me if you need some guidance. I plan to create a tutorial video as well.<br>
