# Donutz-s-iRacing-Button-Dashboard
DIBD is a SimHub dashboard / touchscreen button box escecially created for iRacing. It is not meant to be a standalone dash but rather a support device for PitStop planning and other adjustments during your race. Such as controlling other SimHub dashboards, your wind engine etc.
The header shows track and weather info including a little arrow indicating the development of the specific detail. The footer gives info about your performance against other drivers. Currently you can switch between last lap time and gap/stint/tire compound. Just press the line to switch between these modes.
Please copy the Dons_settings.json file to SimHub\JavascriptExtensions folder and edit it to your likes. To make this Dashboard working you need to install RomainRob's iRacing Extra Properties plugin for Simhub.
Here you can adjust a few color settings but also the label text of the "Dashboard Settings" page. More flexibility is planned for future releases.
