# Donutz-s-iRacing-Button-Dashboard
DIBD is a SimHub dashboard / touchscreen button box escecially created for iRacing. It is not meant to be a standalone dash but rather a support device for PitStop planning and other adjustments during your race. Such as controlling other SimHub dashboards, your wind engine etc.
Please copy the Dons_settings.json file to SimHub\JavascriptExtensions folder and edit it to your likes. To make this Dashboard working you need to install RomainRob's iRacing Extra Properties plugin for Simhub.
